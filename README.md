# mute_comms

A new Flutter project.

## Mute communication system
This project is about trying to bridge the communication gap that exist between people with disability and people without. The project creates a system which provides a platform through which mute (people who can hear but cannot speak) and even the ones that cannot hear or speak; and people without such disabilities can communicate with each other. The app can run on phones, and desktops.
